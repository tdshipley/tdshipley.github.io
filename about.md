## Writing Code to Help Developers Learn More About their Own

__My career is focused on understanding what others in a team are doing.__ The impact
of features that BA's plan, managing the expectations of product owners and analysing changes developers make.

With developers, I write code to hopefully make their lives easier. It could be helping
understand changes to a UI, performance insights or API contract changes.

Here I write about my experiences helping these teams so I can hopefully
remind myself in the future when I forget things I have done but
also help you and your team.
