## Writing Code to Help Developers Learn More About their Own

__My career is focused on understanding what others in a team are doing.__ The impacts
of code changes developers make, features that BA's plan and managing expectations of product owners. However, most of my time is spent with the developers.

With developers, I write code to hopefully make their lives easier. It could be helping
understand functional changes to a UI or non-functional changes such as performance or
API contract changes.

Here I write about my experiences helping these teams so I can hopefully
remind myself in the future when I forget things I have done but
also help you and your team.
