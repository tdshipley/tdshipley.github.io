title: I Enable Engineering Teams and Promote Quality Engineering
---

__My career is focused on understanding what others in a team are doing.__ The impact of planned work,
managing the expectations of stakeholders and analysing development changes.

By asking questions of a team, I can better understand the impacts of these changes. Understanding more, I began to
coach teams. I share my engineering, testing and leadership expertise with the team so they consider a fresh perspective.
__I mentor, pair, persuade and promote towards a goal of whole team quality ownership and successful delivery.__ Sometimes
this is challenging but often worth it!

If you are a QA, I hope you find the site and its content useful in coaching your team.
If not, please think about the ideas on this site.
Discuss them with your team to see if they are right for you.
