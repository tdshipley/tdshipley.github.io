title: I Work in Quality ~~Assurance~~ Advocacy
---

__My career is focused on understanding what others in a team are doing.__ The impact of planned work,
managing the expectations of product owners and analysing development changes.

By asking questions of a team I can better understand the impacts of these changes. Understanding more I begin to
coach teams. Sharing my expertise in testing with the team so they can start thinking more like testers themselves.
__I pair, mentor, promote and persuade towards my goal of shared quality ownership.__ Sometimes
this is challenging but often worth it!

If you are a QA I hope you find the site and its content useful, in coaching your team.
If not, please think about the ideas on this site.
Discuss them with your team or QA to see if they are right for you.
